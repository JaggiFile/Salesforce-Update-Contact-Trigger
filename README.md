# Salesforce Trigger: Update Contact When Account Name Changes

## Description

This Apex trigger updates a custom field on related `Contact` records whenever an `Account`'s `Name` field is changed. It ensures that the `Account_Name__c` field on all child Contacts reflects the latest Account name.

## Use Case

In many Salesforce implementations, business teams want visibility into the Account name directly on the Contact record for quick reference and reporting. This trigger keeps that field synchronized automatically.

## Trigger Details

- **Object**: Account  
- **Event**: `after update`  
- **Purpose**: Auto-update related Contactsâ€™ `Account_Name__c` when Account Name changes  
- **Custom Field** on Contact:
  - `Account_Name__c` (Text, 255)

---

## Logic Overview

1. Loop through `Trigger.new` and compare Account names using `Trigger.oldMap`.
2. Collect IDs of Accounts where the name has changed.
3. Query all Contacts related to those Accounts.
4. Update `Account_Name__c` on each Contact.
5. Perform a single DML update.
